# Problem Statement

A clear description of the user's needs that should be addressed.
- human-centered
- broad enough for creative freedom
- narrow enough to be solved by a design
- establish goals
- understand constraints
- define deliverables
- create benchmarks for success

```

_______________ is a _____________________________________
 [ user name ]             [ user characteristics ]

who needs ________________________________________________
                          [ user need ]

because ________________________________________________
                         [ insight ]

```

Four categories pain points can fall into : 

- Financial, or money-related pain points.
- Product, which are pain points related to quality issues
- Process, which are pain points related to the user’s journey
- Support, which are pain points related to getting help from customer service.

Identifying the pain points your user is experiencing will help you find potential problems that your design can solve.

The most common framework used to create problem statements is the 5 Ws and H framework. After you define the user’s pain points, you can answer who, what, when, where, why, and how to solve the user’s problem.

## The 5 Ws and H: who, what, when, where, why, and how

Who is experiencing the problem? Knowing your users and their background is key to creating successful solutions for them.

What are the pain points you’re trying to solve? Determining a user’s pain points early allows you to answer the rest of these questions and clarify the context of the pain points.

Where is the user when they’re using the product? A user’s physical context matters to your design.

When does the problem occur? Maybe it’s right after the end of a long and tedious process, or maybe it’s something that happens daily. Knowing when the problem occurs can help you better empathize with the user’s feelings.

Why is the problem important? Knowing how this problem affects your user’s experience and life will help to clarify the potential consequences.

How are users reaching their goals by using the product? Understanding how users reach their goals allows you to map the user journey that they take through your product.

# Hypothesis Statement

Our best educated guess on what we think the solution to a design might be

```

if ____________________________________________
                    [ action ]

then __________________________________________
                    [ outcome ]

```

Hypothesis statements don’t have a single standard formula to follow, but there are two common methods you can try using to write one.
- First, you can use the if / then format to come up with a hypothesis statement.
- Second, you can use the we believe format to come up with a hypothesis statement.
- If / then statements focus directly on the needs of users. On the other hand, we believe statements take the perspective of your team into account, while remaining empathetic to the needs of users.

# Value Proposition

The reason why a consumer should use a product or service

what does your product do ? Clearly explain the offering that your product provides users.

why should the user care ? Describe how your product addresses users’ pain points.

- Step 1. Describe your product’s features and benefits. Create a list of all the great features and benefits of your product, big and small.
- Step 2. Explain the value of the product. Anything that you identify as a value proposition needs to be beneficial to your users.
- Step 3. Connect these features and benefits with the needs of your users. The goal is to identify what’s truly valuable to the user and not just a cool feature that users didn’t ask for.

To determine value, take the personas you’ve developed and pair each persona with a value proposition that meets their biggest pain point.

- Step 4. Review your official value proposition list. You’ve narrowed your list down of lots of benefits and features by matching them with actual user needs. Now it’s time to review the list of value propositions your product offers.
