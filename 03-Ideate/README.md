## Competitive Audit -

An overview of your competitor's strengths and weaknesses.
- Identifying key competitors
- Reviewing the products that your competitors offer
- Understanding how your competitors position themselves in the market
- Examining what your competitor does well and what they could do better
- Considering how your competitors talk about themselves

### Direct Competitors
- Have offerings that are similar to your product and focus on the same audience.

### Indirect Competitors
- Have a similar set of offerings but focus on a different audience, or have a different set of offerings and focus on the same audience.

### Benefits to competitive audits -
- Giving you an idea of products already in the market and their designs. 
- Suggesting ideas to solve early problems that you’re facing with your own designs. 
- Revealing the ways that current products in the market are not meeting users’ needs. This is a gap for your product to address!
- Demonstrating the expected life cycle of a product in the same market as yours.
- Informing all the different iterations your product could take and how those performed for your competitors.

## User Flow

The path taken by a typical user on an app or a website, so they can complete a task from start to finish.

UX designers often outline user flows with common shapes: circles, rectangles, diamonds, and lines with arrows.

### Action -
- The actions users take when moving through a product design are represented as circles.
- In other words, circles show steps that must be taken to complete a task from start to finish.

### Screen - 
- The screens of a digital product that users will experience while completing tasks are represented as rectangles.

### Decision - 
- Diamonds represent points in the user flow where users must ask a question and make a decision.
- The decision users make will either move them forward through the flow or back to an earlier part of the flow.

### User flow direction -
- Lines with arrows tie everything together and display the flow of information.
- Solid lines indicate forward direction through the user flow.
- Dotted lines indicate backward direction or returning to a previous page.
