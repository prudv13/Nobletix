As a freelance yoga instructor, homemaker, and NGO founder with impaired vision,

I want to find an event tickets booking app that is easy to use with personalized event recommendations, clear and concise information, and supports a variety of payment methods,

so that I can attend social service and charity events, and organize fundraisers and charitable events through my NGO with ease and convenience.
