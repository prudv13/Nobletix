;# Empathize with Users

Empathizing with potential users is important to every step of the design thinking process.

When you empathize with someone, you share their mental and emotional experiences. Empathy is at the core of everything we do. Approaching UX research with empathy makes it easier for you to solve the right problem.

## Ways to empathize with users - 

- your users directly about their needs and wants, which your product design can address
- ask questions that begin with what, how, and why to gain a deeper understanding of your users’ perspective.
- watch a user interact with you or your product can provide physical cues that can affect your research outcomes.
- take detailed notes or even record your sessions with users.
- Active listening requires you to fully concentrate on, understand, and remember what is being said by the user you’re interacting with.
- request input from a variety of sources and a diverse group of users.
- when asking for feedback, use open-ended questions to understand the user’s actual thoughts on the experience or product.
- set personal biases aside to better empathize with others.

## Recruit Interview Participants

### Screener Survey
- A screener survey is a detailed list of questions that helps researchers determine if potential participants meet the requirements of the research study.
- Send out Google form with a list of questions to potential participants via email.

### Representative Sample
- A representative sample is a subset of the target population that seeks to accurately reflect the characteristics of the larger group.
- The participants in a representative sample should include user groups that have been commonly under-represented in previous research.

### Finding Participants
- Look for potential participants in family, friends, colleagues, managers, peers etc.
- Look for participants in networking websites, online groups
- Third party recruiting agency
- Websites specifically to connect with research participants ( usertesting.com | userinterviews.com )

### Contacting Participants
- Reach out to each participant via Email
- Email Template Attachment : [CLICK HERE](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ubnPKls0FkPpCeibOtaR4P3Lg3v5joOV/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=112855470332759800837&rtpof=true&sd=true)
- Send email remainders one or two days before the interview.

## Prepare for User Interview

- Set Research Goals
- Script Interview Questions
- Collect supplies
- Research the users
- Practice delivering the interview questions

## Interviewing Users

### Meet the Participants
- Build a good rapport
- Thank the participant for coming
- Review legal details (age verification, audio or video recording consent forms)
- Gather basic details (name, demographic information)
- Let participant know there are no right or wrong answers

### Conduct Interview

### Wrap up the interview
- Give users a chance to share any final thoughts
- Always thank the participant again for their time
- Offer any kind of incentive to the participant

# Empathy Maps

Empathy maps are easily understood charts that explain what UX designers have learned about a particular type of user. Empathy maps can help break down each interview into digestible pieces of information.

### Creating an Empathy Map -

### Step 1: Add the user’s name.

```
- Include the name of the person interviewed in your empathy map.
- Having a name attached to it will help if you ever need to look back at the original transcript or research, and it’ll distinguish this map from other maps you create.
```

### Step 2: SAYS

```
- write down exactly what the person said.
- pay special attention to challenges your user states
- record any desired benefits or expectations they mention.
```

### Step 3: THINKS

```
- summarize the thoughts expressed by the user.
- add feelings the user conveyed through body language, tone, or other noticeable indicators.
```

### Step 3: DOES

```
- write down the action the user takes when using a product
```

### Step 4: Feels

```
- List the feelings the user expresses.
- The notes you include may overlap with some of what you listed in the “THINKS” square.
```

# Types Of Empathy Maps

It's important to understand that there are two types of empathy maps: one-user empathy maps and aggregated empathy maps (also known as "multiple-user empathy maps").

One-user empathy maps are created by taking the data from one user's interview and turning it into an empathy map, like the example earlier in this reading. This approach helps designers distill a single user's thoughts, feelings, and traits into a format that's easier to gather data from.

The other kind of empathy map, an aggregated empathy map, represents a group of users who share similar thoughts, opinions, or qualities. Aggregated empathy maps are created by creating multiple one-user empathy maps, then combining the maps where users expressed similar things into a new empathy map. This helps designers identify segments, or groups of people with similar tendencies, who will use the product. The insights in aggregated empathy maps allow designers to identify themes, which helps them better empathize with the groups they are designing for.

# User Pain Points

Any UX issues that frustrate the user and block the user from getting what they need.

### Types of Pain Points - 

1. Financial pain points are user problems related to money, like paywall interruptions.
2. Product pain points are quality issues related to the product. Norman doors fall into this category.
3. Process pain points are frustrations that stop the user going from point A to point B.
4. Support pain points, when users interact with the product they might have questions, if they can't find answers, they won't feel supported. Customer service information that is hidden on the website falls into this category.

# Personas

Fictional users whose goals and characteristics represent the needs of a larger group of users. Personas are built based on research.

- Build empathy: help humanize our users
- Tell stories: turns average stakeholder presentation into a story telling experience.
- One persona isn't enough, Create a set of personas.
- Stress-text designs: time, accessibility, different needs.

# User Stories

- A fictional one-sentence story told from the person's point of view to inspire and inform design decisions.
- Scenarios / User cases.
- Deepens your understanding of a user group.
- Prioritize design goals.
- Unite the team under clear goal
- Inspire empathetic design decisions (user centered approach)
- Personalize pitches to stakeholders
- Hero + goal + conflict that keeps them from conquering that goal.

```
As a _________________, I want to ___________, so that ___________.
      [type of user]                [action]            [benefit]
```

- Type of User : who we are desgining for.
- Action : what the user hopes will happen.
- Benefit : why the user wants the action to happen.

# User Journey

The series of experiences a user has as they achieve a specific goal.
- Helps create obstacle free paths for users
- Reduces impact of designer bias
- Highlights new pain points
- Identifies improvement opportunities

# Accessibility

- Accessibility is not just designing to include a group of users with varying abilities.
- Instead, it extends to anyone who is experiencing a permanent, temporary or situational disability.
