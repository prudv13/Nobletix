# Empathize with Users

Empathizing with potential users is important to every step of the design thinking process.

When you empathize with someone, you share their mental and emotional experiences. Empathy is at the core of everything we do. Approaching UX research with empathy makes it easier for you to solve the right problem.

## Ways to empathize with users - 

- your users directly about their needs and wants, which your product design can address
- ask questions that begin with what, how, and why to gain a deeper understanding of your users’ perspective.
- watch a user interact with you or your product can provide physical cues that can affect your research outcomes.
- take detailed notes or even record your sessions with users.
- Active listening requires you to fully concentrate on, understand, and remember what is being said by the user you’re interacting with.
- request input from a variety of sources and a diverse group of users.
- when asking for feedback, use open-ended questions to understand the user’s actual thoughts on the experience or product.
- set personal biases aside to better empathize with others.
